# Cookie-Refresher

For some time now Roblox has had a system that binds a session cookie to an IP address, so when you try to access the webapp via this session on a different IP address, the session is invalidated and you are sent back to the login screen.

A few websites have popped up from multiple different providers advertising a "cookie refresher", where you put this session cookie into their website, some magic happens, and it spits out a brand new cookie you can use. Here is one of them, of course roblox patched this bypass mechanism some time ago so bypassing region locks doesnt work via this method.
